## Creating an environment in Gazebo

### Step 1: open a terminal and run the following command to start Gazebo

```bash
gazebo

```

### 🏗️ Step 2: Open the Building Editor

From the top menu, go to **Edit → Building Editor**  .
This opens the design interface where you can create your own **custom environment** in Gazebo.

### Step 3: Design Your Environment

You can create your environment by selecting and placing walls in the **2D view**.  
You can also add features such as **doors, walls, and stairs**.  

In the **3D view**, you can apply **textures and colors** to your environment to make it more realistic.

### Step 4: Import Images

You can import images from the **Import** menu.  
This allows you to easily build your desired **environment** from a map.

### Step 5: Save and View Your Environment

After creating your environment, go to the **File** menu and choose **Save**.  
Specify a **Model Name** and **Location** where your model will be saved.  

Finally, click **Editor Building Exit** to close the editor and view your environment in Gazebo.

### Step 6: Add Features

You can add more details to your environment by selecting **Model Editor** from the **Edit** menu.  
This allows you to insert and customize additional models, objects, and features in your simulation world.

### Step 7: Add Simple Features and Models

You can add simple features from **Simple Shapes**, or insert objects and models from the **Model Database** — such as a **café table**, **house model**, or other available assets.  
These additions help you create a more realistic and detailed simulation environment.

> 💡 **Hint:** You can change the **density**, **size**, **color** and other features of simple shapes by clicking on **Open Link Inspector**.

### Step 8: Save and View Your Model

Now you can save your model with the **.world** extension and click **Exit Model Editor**.  
Your entire model will then be visible in the Gazebo simulation environment.

## How to Run the Simulation on Your Laptop

### Step 1: Install Dependent ROS 2 Packages

Run the following commands to install Cartographer and Navigation2:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-cartographer
sudo apt install ros-humble-cartographer-ros

sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
```

### Step 2 : Install TurtleBot3 Packages

Set up your **TurtleBot3 workspace** and clone the required packages by running the following commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/

git clone -b humble https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git
git clone -b humble https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
git clone -b humble https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git

sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
colcon build --symlink-install

echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

### Step 3 : Configure Environment Variables

Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file to configure your environment for **TurtleBot3** and **Gazebo**:

```bash
echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 # TURTLEBOT3' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 4 : Install Simulation Package

Install the **TurtleBot3 Simulation** package by running the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/
git clone -b humble https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Step 5: Launch the TurtleBot3 Simulation

After completing the setup, you can launch different TurtleBot3 worlds in Gazebo.  

**1. Launch an empty world:**

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo empty_world.launch.py

```

**2. Launch a TurtleBot3 World:**

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

**2. Launch a TurtleBot3 House:**

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch.py
```

### Step 6: Control Your Robot with the Keyboard

You can move your TurtleBot3 robot in any of the Gazebo environments using your keyboard.  
Run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
```
