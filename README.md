### Step 4: Edit the Spawn File

Open the `spawn_turtlebot3.launch.py` file located in the **launch** folder of the TurtleBot3 Gazebo package.

Add the following lines in the appropriate place within the file to include the **yaw** parameter (for controlling the robot’s orientation):

```python

x_pose = LaunchConfiguration('x_pose', default='0.0')
y_pose = LaunchConfiguration('y_pose', default='0.0')
yaw = LaunchConfiguration('yaw', default='3.14')

declare_yaw_cmd = DeclareLaunchArgument(
    'yaw', default_value='3.14',
    description='Yaw orientation (in radians) of the robot'
)

start_gazebo_ros_spawner_cmd = Node(
    package='gazebo_ros',
    executable='spawn_entity.py',
    arguments=[
        '-entity', TURTLEBOT3_MODEL,
        '-file', urdf_path,
        '-x', x_pose,
        '-y', y_pose,
        '-z', '0.01',
        '-Y', yaw
    ],
    output='screen',
)

ld.add_action(declare_yaw_cmd)

```

### Step 4: Save the Map

Open a terminal in the folder where you want to save your map, then run:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f my_map
```

## Automatic Robot Navigation in the Environment

### Step 1: Edit `burger.yaml`

Open the `burger.yaml` file to change the robot motion model.  
Run the following command:

```bash
gedit /opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_navigation2/param/burger.yaml
```

Then, replace:

```yaml
robot_model_type: "differential"
```
with
```yaml
robot_model_type: "nav2_amcl::DifferentialMotionModel"
```

### Step 2: Run TurtleBot3

Run TurtleBot3 in your custom environment by executing:

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_myworld.launch.py
```

### Step 3: Run Nav2

Open a terminal **in the folder where your map is saved**, then run:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py \
    use_sim_time:=true \
    map:=my_map.yaml

```
