## Creating an environment in Gazebo

### Step 1: open a terminal and run the following command to start Gazebo

```bash
gazebo

```

### 🏗️ Step 2: Open the Building Editor

From the top menu, go to **Edit → Building Editor**  .
This opens the design interface where you can create your own **custom environment** in Gazebo.

### Step 3: Design Your Environment

You can create your environment by selecting and placing walls in the **2D view**.  
You can also add features such as **doors, walls, and stairs**.  

In the **3D view**, you can apply **textures and colors** to your environment to make it more realistic.

### Step 4: Import Images

You can import images from the **Import** menu.  
This allows you to easily build your desired **environment** from a map.

### Step 5: Save and View Your Environment

After creating your environment, go to the **File** menu and choose **Save**.  
Specify a **Model Name** and **Location** where your model will be saved.  

Finally, click **Editor Building Exit** to close the editor and view your environment in Gazebo.

### Step 6: Add Features

You can add more details to your environment by selecting **Model Editor** from the **Edit** menu.  
This allows you to insert and customize additional models, objects, and features in your simulation world.

### Step 7: Add Simple Features and Models

You can add simple features from **Simple Shapes**, or insert objects and models from the **Model Database** — such as a **café table**, **house model**, or other available assets.  
These additions help you create a more realistic and detailed simulation environment.

> 💡 **Hint:** You can change the **density**, **size**, **color** and other features of simple shapes by clicking on **Open Link Inspector**.
